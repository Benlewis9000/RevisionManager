# RevisionManager
Command line tool devised to keep track of information learnt and prompt you to revise them at specified intervals of time.

The initial aims of this project were to begin to learn file I/O with Java, working with external libraries (ANSI) whilst also creating a functional and useful tool.

This project is no longer maintained. A short critique of the code would include my improper user of Exception handling (see Error.java), poor data storage (text flatfile vs JSON or even SQL - although those were beyond the scope of the project at the time), misuse of Optionals and abundant static abuse.
